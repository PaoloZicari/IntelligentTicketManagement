# IntelligentTicketManagement
A Deep Ensemble Learning Model for Classification and Explanation of Tickets for Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

Intelligent Ticket Management System is Deep Ensemble Neural Network model used to classify and explain tickets. The ensemble uses four deep base classifier architectures: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and Transformer.
Two ensemble combiners are provided: Stacking and MOE.
Moreover, explanation is supported with the generation of word clouds and LIME (Locally Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) methods.
